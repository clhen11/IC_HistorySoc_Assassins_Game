      <h2>Out of Bounds Areas</h2>
      <ul style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.6;">
        <li>Lecture theatres when a lecture (or any kind of official event) is in progress.</li>
        <li>Official practicals and laboratories.</li>
        <li>Bathrooms and toilets.</li>
        <li>Any place where you are required to wait or book an appointment to receive a service (such as Careers Service).</li>
        <li>All Halls (no tailgating or sneaking into corridors/kitchens/rooms). Ambushing a Target when they leave their Halls is acceptable, but if the Assassin is seen they need to back away and allow their Target to leave the building. Preventing someone from leaving a building with a single exit by waiting outside is not allowed.</li>
        <li>Beit Quadrangle is part of the Game Area, and so are the Union, Metric and FiveSixEight (as well as the whole building above them). <b>Beit Halls are OoB.</b></li>
        <li>The area immediately surrounding any bar is OoB. This includes people seated at the barside as well as those buying drinks. Be careful not to cause targets or bystanders to spill drinks.</li>
        <li>The immediate vicinity of a till inside a campus shop. This includes a queue for one. Be careful when assassinating others in shops so that you do not inconvenience shoppers or staff around you.</li>
        <li>Anyone in a car or other motorised vehicle.</li>
        <li>Anyone on a bicycle in the vicinity of other traffic (including other bicycles); only attack if there is no possibility of causing an accident or injury.</li>
        <li>The Imperial Shuttle service (or any other form of University provided transport).</li>
        <li>Auditoria of theatres/cinemas and concert halls during and immediately preceding/following a performance or rehearsal. Any area in which a scheduled play, recital, concert, or any other similar scheduled event is being performed counts as an auditorium. Areas in which backstage preparation work is taking place are also OoB.</li>
        <li>Any event by the Imperial History Society.</li>
        <li>Other societies may also request that their events be OoB.</li>
        <li>Players involved in these events are OoB from the moment they enter the rooms or area where the event is being hosted and until 2 minutes after either the meeting has concluded or they have left the rooms or area (even if they intend to return). People setting up for or clearing up after a society meeting are OoB.</li>
        <li>If you are planning to attack someone near their society meeting, you may check with the Umpire(s) as to whether there is any reason your target may be OoB.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>OoB societies:</b> History, Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy, Artsoc, ICXCAC, Physics Society.</p>
